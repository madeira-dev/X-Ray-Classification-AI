# X-Ray Classification AI

This is a project I implemented to learn more about Machine Learning, Convolutional Neural Network, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix...

The idea is to classify the images stored in the subdirectories under classification-challenge/classification-challenge-starter/Covid19-dataset/train as pneumonia, Covid-19 or no illness.
